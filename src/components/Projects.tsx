      title: "Semantic Book Recommendation Using LLMs and Vector Search",
      description: "Developed a semantic book recommendation system leveraging large language models (LLMs) and vector search techniques. Processed and cleaned text data, built a vector database, and implemented book recommendations using similarity search. Integrated LangChain for efficient text splitting and retrieval. Additionally, explored zero-shot text classification and sentiment analysis to enhance recommendation quality. Designed a user-friendly Gradio dashboard for seamless interaction.",
